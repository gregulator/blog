# Introducing Greg Prisament's Blog

Hi folks!

For a while now I've been thinking of starting a blog, and there's no time like
the present. This blog will contain assorted musings on topics of interest to
me, including:
- Software architecture
- Engineering management and culture
- Robotics
- Loudspeaker design & audiophilia
- And more!

Within each topic, I hope to share some unique perspectives that hopefully
people find useful or inspiring.

Stay tuned for more...
